# Visualising celestial objects using VTK

Extension of a university assignment to visualise Mars using a high-res texture
and topography data from the MOLA mission (https://tharsis.gsfc.nasa.gov/MOLA/mola.php).

This extension uses the same visualisation techniques but with better data sources,
and includes options for visualising the Moon as well as Pluto, in addition to Mars.
